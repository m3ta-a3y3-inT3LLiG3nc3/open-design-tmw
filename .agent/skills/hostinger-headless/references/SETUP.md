# Setup — plan check and website provisioning

Everything here uses the **hosting** MCP operations. If they're missing, ask the user to enable the Websites product group in the Hostinger Connector (or use the `hostinger-hosting-mcp` scoped binary).

## 1. Plan check (gate — run this first)

A website can only be created on an active hosting plan.

1. `hosting_websites_list` — if it returns websites, the account has a working plan; note any existing `order_id` and `username` for step 2.
2. Otherwise `hosting_orders_list` — look for an order in a usable state. A fresh order that has never hosted a website still works; note its `order_id`.
3. Agency Plan orders are not in that list: check `agency-hosting_orders_list` too. An active Agency order is a usable plan — create the website with `agency-hosting_website-setups_create` and poll `agency-hosting_website-setups_status` until `completed` (it returns the `website_uid`), then deploy with the Agency operations in the `deploy-to-hosting` skill.
4. If there is no usable order: **stop and tell the user** that an active Hostinger hosting plan is required to deploy, link https://www.hostinger.com/web-hosting, and offer to continue building the site locally in the meantime. When they confirm the purchase, re-run this check.

Never purchase a plan, domain, or any paid item without the user explicitly approving that specific purchase.

## 2. Choose the domain

- **Default: free subdomain.** `hosting_domains_generate-free-subdomain` returns a `*.hostingersite.com` domain. No verification needed. Tell the user a custom domain can be connected later.
- **User-owned domain:** `hosting_domains_verify-ownership` first. If not accessible, relay the TXT record it returns, remind them propagation can take ~10 minutes, and re-verify before continuing.
- **New domain purchase:** only on explicit request — check availability with `domains_availability_check`, state the price, and get an explicit yes before `domains_portfolio_purchase` (needs the domains product group).

## 3. Create the website and wait for it

Generating a subdomain does **not** create a website — deploying straight to it fails with `No website found for domain`. The working sequence:

1. `hosting_websites_create { domain, order_id }` — `datacenter_code` is required only for the first website on a brand-new plan (pick the first entry from `hosting_datacenters_list`).
2. **Poll** `hosting_websites_list-setups` filtered by the domain every 10–15 s until `status` is `completed`. The site shows up in `hosting_websites_list` before its setup finishes, and uploads, deploys and database calls return 404 or 409 until then. Creation takes up to a few minutes — don't fail fast.
3. Note the site's `username` — deployment and database operations are keyed on it.

If the domain already has a website (an `iterate` run, or the user pointed at an existing site), skip creation entirely.

## 4. Optional extras (only when the run needs them)

- **Database:** when the app needs MySQL, follow `DATABASE.md` — creating it, which host each runtime connects to (Node.js must use `127.0.0.1`), and handing the credentials to the app without hard-coding them.
- **DNS records:** the DNS operations (`dns_records_update` etc.) for custom-domain records; take a snapshot (`dns_snapshots_list` context) before destructive changes.
